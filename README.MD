Configure your IDE JAR FILES:
    Eclipse: Right-click on your project, select "Build Path" -> "Configure Build Path". In the "Libraries" tab, 
            click on "Add JARs" or "Add External JARs" and navigate to the JAR file in the "lib" directory. Select the JAR file and click "OK".
    IntelliJ IDEA: Right-click on your project, select "Open Module Settings" or "Open Project Structure".
                    In the dialog that opens, navigate to "Libraries" and click on the "+" button. Choose "Java" or 
                "From Files or Directories", and browse to the JAR file in the "lib" directory. Select the JAR file and click "OK".

Refresh  project: After adding the JAR file and configuring your IDE, you may need to refresh your project to ensure the changes take effect.
                This step depends on your development environment or IDE.

Import and use the library: Once the JAR file is added to your project, you can import the classes or packages from the
                            library into your code and use them as needed.
